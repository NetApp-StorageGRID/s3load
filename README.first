This script creates/deletes millions of objects in an S3 repository with dummy data. Used for generating artificial load, or preloading data for cosbench, since cosbench is particularly slow

Steps to follow

1. Create config file. 
    - default is s3load.config
    - s3load.js has the format

2. Run  (example)
    $ node s3load.js --cmd pb

3. To install and then run
    $ cd <directory where s3load has been downloaded>
    $ sudo npm install -g
    $ s3load
